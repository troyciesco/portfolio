      <p class="text-lg mb-4 max-w-prose">
        I have experience working with enterprise companies, small businesses, blockchain startups, and everything in
        between. I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript development, particularly with React, and I have professional
        experience with other technologies like Python and GraphQL. I also spent six years in the US Army Reserve.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg max-w-prose">
        My hobbies include baseball, video games, and studying history. Iâ€™ve also recently picked up photography and
        guitar, and it's been fun being a rookie at both. I live in Mansfield, CT.
