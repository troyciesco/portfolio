I'm going to try out this new idea where I write a blog post about what I've worked on (almost) every day. You can call it "learning in public" if you want - at this point I'm thinking of it as a way to keep myself on track.

I have an ever-growing Excel spreadsheet of ideas for websites, web apps, startups, software utilities, blog posts, tutorials, courses, etc. etc. etc. The problem is that they all seem to have the potential to be super fun and interesting, so I'm constantly in this mode of exploring the first 5% of every project. The result of this is a lot of code on my local that never sees the light of day.

I don't think I necessarily need to finish every single project. But right now the value of mostly everything I've worked on just lives in my head (or in the private repos of companies I've worked for, who definitely prefer that you finish your work). It's kinda pointless there. It provides value to me in that I've *learned something*, but if all I do is learn stuff and never produce anything eventually, there was pretty much no use in learning it in the first place.

I think this is also going to be a way to break a project into smaller chunks (something I'm *wicked* bad at). Instead of being super amped up and trying to launch an intricate e-commerce application and associated course all in a single pizza-fueled coding session, I can just focus on producing something for the day in the form of a blog post. Instead of one massive deliverable at the end of the project, the daily blog posts themselves become deliverables. CI/CD for your brain.

This is kind of how I picture it working:
- I figure out what I'm going to work on that day. It can be part of a larger theme (build a yoga studio website template) or maybe just a one day project (url shortener).
- I get to work, keeping track of the steps I take and the obstacles I run into.
- At the end of the day, I take 30 - 60 minutes to document all of this as best I can, and I post it even if it's kind of rough.

Some benefits:
- Even if I didn't accomplish that much with code that day, I got better at writing. I still shipped.
- I think it'll offer an opportunity to improve my git commits, since it'll be a lot easier to keep track of what I'm doing if I commit frequently.
- If I want to turn a project into a tutorial or course after I'm done with it, *I've already done a lot of the work*. I'll just need to clean up the content from the relevant posts and make them easy to follow.

I'm currently taking a class on Early Modern Britain at Harvard, so I've been trying to come up with good :superscript{content='analogy' number='1'} between web development and blacksmithing. So far the best thing I've got is this: it doesn't matter if you know how to create the coolest, most intricate suit of armor ever if all you do is sit in your forge and think about how great you are. You still need to prove it by making things, even if it's just some nails or horseshoes at first.

I'm not really planning on actively sharing this section of work, but I hope if someone stumbles across it they'll find it useful - either for the nonsense I write or as guidelines for how they can try to wrangle the chaos of their project list.

For some reason, I can **never** remember this word. Seriously. I said it out loud the night before I wrote this and I still had to google "what's the word when you draw connections between two different things" for this post.
